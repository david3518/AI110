\textbf{(CBSE Class 11, Exercise 16.4 example no 9 )} if      $\dfrac{2}{11}$ is the probability of an event.What is the probability of the event "A".
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph{enumerate})]
    \item find the probability of event not "A"
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\section{Solution}
\begin{frame}{Solution}

\begin{itemize}

\item given probability of "A" i.e P(A)=\dfrac {2}{11}

\item we know that probability of not A i.e
 P(NOT A) = 1 -$\dfrac{2}{11}$
 
\item P(NOT"A") = $\dfrac{9}{11}$
 \item the probability of the event not "A" = $\dfrac{9}{11}$
\end{itemize}
